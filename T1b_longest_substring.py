# _Topic_ @1 Pattern: Sliding Window
# _Q_ @1. b)
# _Difficulty_ medium


#Â Problem Statement:
"""
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.
Example 1:
Input: String="araaci", K=2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct characters is "araa".
Example 2:
Input: String="araaci", K=1
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct characters is "aa".
Example 3:
Input: String="cbbebi", K=3
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters are "cbbeb" & "bbebi".

# my solution
# broute force would be looking at all possible substrings -> O(n!)??
# try implementing sliding window instead.
# window is not fixed size (difficulty up..?)
# Idea: 
# have array
# have start and end
# add elem check if <=k distinct chars
# if yes increase max
# else delete from front until <=k?
