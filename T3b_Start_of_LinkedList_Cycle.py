# _Topic_ @3 Pattern: Fast & Slow pointers

# Problem statement:
"""
Given the head of a Singly LinkedList that contains a cycle, write a function to find the starting node of the cycle.
"""

# My solution:
# looks hard :(
class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):

	# then take only slow and new pointer
	# check where they meet, new pointer counts; 
	# that's the position.
